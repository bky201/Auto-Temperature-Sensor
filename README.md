This project conducted at Jacobs University to elaborate the design and construction of 
smart temperature monitoring and controlling with a fan to the room temperature or surrounding. 
The temperature sensor was carefully chosen to adapt into the room temperature, 
in addition that the fan will start to rotate and increase automatically if the room temperature is increased. 
The speed of the fan depends on the temperature starting from 20 degrees Celsius and there
is no need to regulate the fan manually again and again.
